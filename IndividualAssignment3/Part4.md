# Part 4: Technical Analysis of Investments

Technical analysis involves evaluating investments based on historical price and volume trend data. It assumes that stock patterns repeat over time, and that market psychology plays an important role in asset movements.

## 🔑 Key Ideas

### 1. What Is Technical Analysis?

Technical analysis uses charts, patterns, and indicators to predict future price movements. Common tools include moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), candlestick patterns, and support/resistance levels.

### 2. Benefits

- Useful for identifying entry and exit points.
- Can be automated and applied quickly across many assets.
- Popular with traders and algorithms due to visual and statistical nature.

### 3. Limitations

- Based on historical data — there is no guarantee of future results.
- May lead to false signals in volatile or low-volume markets.
- Often ignores broader economic conditions or a company's underlying fundamentals, which would be better supported through fundamental analysis.

Technical analysis could be used to enrich the knowledge graph with time series-based nodes and indicators. For example, time-series data such as volume trends and momentum could support event-based prediction or graph-based reasoning around market behaviour.
